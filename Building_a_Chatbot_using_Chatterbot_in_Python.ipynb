        "What is a Chatbot?\n",
        "\n",
        "The term “chatterbot” came in existence in 1994 when Michael Mauldin created his first chatbot named “Julia”. As per the Oxford Dictionary, a chatbot is defined as “A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.” It can be looked upon as a virtual assistant that communicates with users via text messages and helps businesses in getting close to their customers. It is a program designed to imitate the way humans communicate with each other. It can be done through a chat interface or by voice call. Developers usually design chatbots so that it is difficult to tell for users whether they are communicating with a person or a robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatbots helps any business/organization in accomplishing the following goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "Increases operational efficiency.\n",
        "Automating customer request fulfillment.\n",
        "Handling basic queries, which in turn free employees to work for complex & higher value inquiries.\n",
        "Offers Multi-language support.\n",
        "Saves time & effort by automating customer support.\n",
        "Improves the response rate as well as customer engagement.\n",

        "How does a Chatbot Work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatbots are nothing but software applications that have an application layer, a database, and APIs. To simplify the working of the chatbot, we can say it works on pattern matching to classify text and produce a suitable response for the questions/queries addressed by the user. The chatbot responds to the user as per the program that has been fed in it. Chatbots are of different types, depending on how they are used. Mainly there are three types of chatbots, and they are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Rule-Based Chatbot: This is the basic chatbot made, the user interacts with this kind of bot by using predefined options. To get answers from these bots, users need to click on certain options. These kinds of bots collect the user's request, analyze it, and then offer results in the form of buttons. These bots are commonly used to replace frequently asked questions when it comes to complex queries; they aren't always the best solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent(Keyword) Chatbots: These are machine learning bots, unlike rule-based chatbots, they analyze what the user wants and respond appropriately. These chatbots use customizable keywords and machine learning to determine how to respond to users' requests effectively and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "NLP (Contextual) Chatbots: These are so far the most advanced chatbots. They are a combination of best from rule-based and keyword chatbots. These chatbots use NLP to understand the context and intent in users' requests and thus act accordingly. These chatbots can handle multiple requests from the same user at ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparisons of Chatbot Platforms\n",
        "\n",
        "Many platforms offer customized chatbots with automation making seamless, always on-time, best in class support services available to customers whenever they need it without the box conversational capacities. Customers are also keen to purchase from a business that they can easily connect over messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Listing down the AI chatbot building platform in 2020:\n",
        "\n",
        "Azure Bot Service: Azure bot service offers to build a chatbot from scratch, i.e., you can build, connect, test, and deploy. It allows developers to use the open-source SDK and tools. It also enables developers to create advanced bots such as virtual assistants to handle complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Botsify: This tool's uniqueness is that it enables non-technical users to build a chatbot with its intuitive interface. Bots are represented here as stories, i.e., you can create multiple stories or multiple chatbots and deploy them as per the requirement. Another great feature is the ability to save users' responses to a form that can be easily exported to a CSV.\n",
        "\n",
        "Amazon Lex: Amazon lex allows developers to build conversational interfaces using text and voice. It comes up with advanced deep learning functionalities and NLP for understanding the context of the text. It provides an easy to use console for building chatbot in minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mobile Monkey: Mobile monkey offers developers to build chatbots specifically for marketing purposes. It allows developers to make Facebook ad bots, SMS bots, and native web chatbots all in a single platform. They also offer ready-made chatbot templates for every business possible, which can be directly embedded on a website.\n",
        "\n",
        "ChatterOn: It claims to handle different types of rich content responses from the Bot as it allows developers to connect different APIs at each interaction with the user. ChatterOn offers more than 20 pre-built bolts that can be put to use in a single click. It doesn’t require much coding, which makes it easier for non-technical users to build chatbots.\n",
        "\n",
        "TARS: It offers you to build a conversational landing page, which enables you to create an automated chatbot to greet you, customers, give them relevant information about their queries regarding your products, and ask for their contact simultaneously. Tars offers many pre-defined chatbot templates, which are classified into two parts - by industry and by use-case.\n",
        "\n",
        "By now, you must be curious to build a chatbot of your own. And what's better than a customizable NLP chatbot? Let's get started for building our very own chatbot in Python using library chatterbot.\n",

        "As the name suggests, chatterbot is a python library specifically designed to generate chatbots. This algorithm uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to fabricate varying responses to users as per their requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatterbot makes it easier to develop chatbots that can engage in conversations. It starts by creating an untrained chatterbot that has no prior experience or knowledge regarding how to communicate. As the users enter statements, the library saves the request made by the user as well as it also saves the responses that are sent back to the users. As the number of instances increases in chatterbot, the accuracy of the responses made by chatterbot also increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatterbot is trained to search the closest analogous response by finding the closest analogous request made by users that is equivalent to the new request made. Then it selects a response from the already existing responses. The USP of chatterbot is that it enables developers to create their own dataset and structures at ease.\n",

        "Building a Chatbot using Chatterbot\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's begin by installing the chatterbot library. For creating chatbot also need to install chatterbot corpus. Corpus - literal meaning is a collection of words. This contains a corpus of data that is included in the chatterbot module. Each corpus is nothing but a prototype of different input statements and their responses. These corpus are used by bots to train themselves. The most recommended method for installing chatterbot and chatterbot_corpus is by using pip.\n",
